        <h3>About me</h3>
<p>
    My name is Erik. I was born on February 22, 2004. My main belief in life is that everything should be in harmony. People have to keep balance in all spheres of life: society, family, work, friendship, and others. I graduated from the high school in 2019 and while in school i earned exemplary academic performance and leadership skills. In 2020 went to college. </p>
